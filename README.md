# Jetpack-Compose-Playground

This repository contains a collection of concise write ups and demos on building some Jetpack Compose layouts and components that I have personally used in some of my android app projects. Each component can be added to any android app by simply copying the file to your app. Some are demos I found online and others are components that I have used in the past.
